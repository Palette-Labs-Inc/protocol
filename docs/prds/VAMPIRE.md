# Vampire Attack Resistance, Multi-Homing

## Problem Statement
How can the network employ a design to ensure resilience against vampire attacks? A vampire-attack resistant architecture would imply strong properties. 

How can the network employ a design that is resistant to multi-homing tendencies in traditional platforms? For example, drivers and merchants are prone to simaltaneously using many competitive services. In food delivery many restaurants tend to use more than 3 delivery services (DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub). 
A multi-homing resistant architecture that continuously encourages new entrants to adopt the standard framework (instead of creating a new network) would imply strong / desireable properties.

# Goals:
- The design should resist vampire attacks and discourage multi-homing behavior.
- The mechanisms should reward providers proportionally to the utility they provide, while also discouraging mass migration and multi-homing.
- Encourage new entrants to adopt the network's framework rather than creating competing networks.

## Potential Mechanisms
Below are some things I am thinking about within the context of the stated problem, but these are probably not mathematically elegant solutions. 

- Implement lock-in periods to prevent immediate withdrawals after receiving incentives. Implement staking rewards 
- Limit the number of tokens that can be withdrawn within a certain timeframe to avoid sudden liquidity drains.
- Generally, development of utility or benefits surrounding the network that make it psychologically discouraging to depart to a new network.
