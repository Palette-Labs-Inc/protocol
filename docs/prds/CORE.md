# Abstract
The network is designed as a set of rules and technical specifications for building open e-commerce networks across which providers and their services are universally discoverable from any protocol-enabled application.

## Network Participants

#### Buyer
An individual with a need to purchase a product or service at a given moment in time. 

#### Buyer Supporting Node (BSN)
`BSNs` build software applications & store Buyer data for the network. BSNs can be managed by individual developers or organizations who intend to offer experiences to consumers but do not care to maintain inventory lists of producers.  

#### Producer 
An organization with a Catalog of products or services available for sale. 

#### Producer Supporting Node (PSN)
`PSN`s onboard the producer side of the network. PSNs can be managed by a local chamber of commerce, a small business cooperative, individual restaurants or retailers, taxi-networks, big tech companies, etc. The primary role of the `PSN` in the open network is to attain and maintain fresh inventory lists for producers such that when a `Buyer` broadcasts an intent to transact, they can be sure that their request to avail services/products is fulfilled by the `Producer` 

#### Node Operator
A `PSN` or `BSN` providing services to a Buyer or Producer within the network, occupying a record in the Registry.
