### Abstract

This study proposes a new communication standard; a set of rules and technical specifications for building open e-commerce networks across which providers and their services are universally discoverable from any protocol-enabled application. 

### Network Participants

#### Buyer
An individual with a need to purchase a product or service at a given moment in time. The `Buyer` is interested in joining the network to discover and purchase goods or services. The `Buyer` can engage with the network by using a protocol enabled application. 

#### Producer 
An organization or individual with a Catalog of products or services available for sale. 

#### Buyer Supporting Node (BSN)
`BSNs` are managed hosts that onboard the `Buyer` side of the network. These hosts typically build software applications. `BSNs` can be managed by individual developers or organizations who intend to offer experiences to consumers. `BSNs` might have a new idea for a new application, like a video-first shopping app, a social-commerce app, or a spatial-computing shopping experience. `BSNs` implement the protocol because it gives them instant access to a network of `Producers`. They can implement the protocol standard and get access to these `Producers` without ever having to formally onboard the `Producer` or communicate with them. This is beneficial because it increases their ability to quickly test their product. They only have to worry about dealing with one side of the two-sided market.

#### Producer Supporting Node (PSN)
`PSN`s are managed hosts that onboard the producer or seller side of the network. `PSNs` can be managed by a restaurant group, an individual restaurant, taxi-networks, an individual taxi driver, a big tech company, or any other organization that represents an individual or group of individual selling a good or a service. `PSNs` onboard into the protocol network to reach new consumers who want to purchase the services of the `Producers` they represent. 

The primary role of the `PSN` in the network is to attain and maintain fresh inventory lists for producers such that when a `Buyer` broadcasts an intent to transact, they can respond with the `Providers` that are capable of fulfilling the `Buyers` request.

`PSNs` can charge a fee for providing tools to `Producers` to help them maintain their inventory and accept more orders. Some `Producers` may choose to run their own server. This is within scope of the network, and any individual producer can do so, but requiring every `Producer` to run their own server is a steep UX requirement. 

`BSNs` and `PSNs` are non-profit organizations, universities, or any other company or group that host usersâ€™ data, like Gmail and Outlook host email. Managed hosts can offer features that would be impractical for users to run at scale, like a recommendation system. They can provide better user experiences, and we should expect most people to use them instead of running their own server.

#### Node Operator
A `PSN` or `BSN` providing services to a `Buyer` or `Producer` within the network, occupying a record in the `Registry`. 

### Public Network Infrastructure

#### Gateway Provider (GP)
`GP`s or `Gateways` route search packets from BSN's and index services that help `BSNs` discover relevant `Providers` during a `Buyers` discovery process.

        Gateway-->>-PSNn: ACK
        Note over Gateway,PSNn: PSN(n) triggers callback w/ provider list
    end
 ```

#### Registry 
A decentralized public ledger that maintains the records of Node Operators, agents and their supported Industry Codes and the geographical regions that they represent. The registry is queried for a Producers products or services by `Gateway Providers` and `Buyer Supporting Nodes` during the search phase of a `Buyers` transaction lifecycle 

During the server-to-server communication node's are expected to send a signed digest of the request body using the private key that was used to register their node. When a server recives a new request, it verifies the signature header by looking up the public key of the signer in the registry and verifying the signature.

    Note over REGISTRY,PSN: PSN finds public-key of BSN in registry

    Note over PSN_VS: PSN verifies BSN signature
