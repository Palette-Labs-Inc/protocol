  type: apiKey
  in: header
  name: Signature
  description: >
    This header authenticates requests using a digital signature. The format for the `Authorization` header is as follows:
    
    `Signature keyId="{registry_node_uid}",algorithm="ecdsa-p256-keccak256",created="1606970629",expires="1607030629",headers="(created) (expires) digest",signature="Base64url(secp256k1(signing string))"`
    
    Where:
    - `registry_node_uid` The unique registry identifier of the sending node
    - `algorithm` specifies the cryptographic algorithm used, here "ecdsa-p256-keccak256".
    - `created` is the UNIX timestamp when the signature was created.
    - `expires` is the UNIX timestamp when the signature expires.
    - `headers` details the parts of the request that are signed, specifically the creation time, expiration time, and the digest.
    - `signature` is the digital signature, encoded in Base64url, created by signing the specified headers with the node's private key using the secp256k1 curve.
